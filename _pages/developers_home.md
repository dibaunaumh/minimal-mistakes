## About
The Wed-Wide-Matrix is a non-profit open-source initiative. Our goal is to fix the problem of information overload
by introducing a new medium for effectively consuming information.

The technology bits for processing content feeds into easily consumable organized spaces already exist today, but we
need a common abstraction to tie them all together to make them effective & ubiquitous.


### Roadmap

We're currently working on a [proof-of-concept](https://github.com/dibaunaumh/webwidematrix-poc) of the Matrix cloud & hovercraft.

The 1st milestone delivery of the matrix is planned for early 2017.

## The team

We're currently a small team of engineers, based in Boston Massachusetts, but looking to grow into a global organization.
This organization will define the specs for the Matrix & deliver the initial frameworks & implementations of the different components.


### Organization structure

We believe in self-organizing teams & holacracy. The organization behind the Matrix is using an experimental structure called [Groupoid](https://dibau.wordpress.com/2016/11/30/groupoid-organization-structure/).

### Join us

We're currently looking for more engineers (`Scala`, `Python`, `Unity3D`), architects, designers & thought leaders. Sign up to join the core team & help us impact the life of billions of people.
