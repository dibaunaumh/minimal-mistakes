## About
The Wed-Wide-Matrix is a non-profit open-source initiative. Our goal is to fix the problem of information overload
by introducing a new medium for effectively consuming information.

The technology bits for processing content feeds into easily consumable organized spaces already exist today, but we
need a common abstraction to tie them all together into an effective & ubiquitous solution.


### Roadmap

We're currently working on a [proof-of-concept](https://github.com/WebWideMatrix/webwidematrix-poc) of the Matrix cloud & hovercraft.

The 1st milestone delivery of the matrix is planned for early 2017.

## The team

We're currently a small team of engineers, based in Boston USA, but hoping to grow into a global open-source organization.
This organization will define the specs for the Matrix & deliver the initial frameworks & implementations of its different components.


### Join us

We're currently looking for more engineers (`Python`, `Scala` & `Unity3D`), architects, designers & thought leaders.
Join the core team to help us solve the problem of information-overload & impact the lives of millions of people.
