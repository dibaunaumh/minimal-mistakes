## About
The Wed-Wide-Matrix is a non-profit open-source initiative. Our goal is to fix the problem of **information overload**
by introducing a **new medium** for effectively consuming information.

The technology bits for processing content feeds into easily consumable organized spaces already exist today, but we
need a common abstraction to tie them all together into an effective & ubiquitous solution.

## The team

We're currently a small team of engineers, based in the Boston area, but hoping to grow into a global open-source organization.
This organization will define the specs of the Web-Wide-Matrix & deliver the initial frameworks & implementations.

### Our roadmap

We're currently working on a [proof-of-concept](https://github.com/WebWideMatrix/webwidematrix-poc) of the Matrix cloud & hovercraft.

The 1st milestone delivery of the matrix is planned for the 2nd half of 2017.


### Join us

We're currently looking for engineers (`Python`, `Elixir` & `Unity3D`), architects & artists to join our core team.
Join us to help solve the problem of information-overload & impact the lives of millions of people.
