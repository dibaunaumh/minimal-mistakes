<h2>Hey, welcome to our project</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prior to the Web, information & data was available in files & databases, located on specific computers & networks, but it was extremely difficult to access it
<li>The Web introduced an access layer - a uniform standard way to access any information & data from files & databases around the world
<li>The problem is that although we now have access to tons of valuable information & data, we only have time for consuming a tiny fraction of the data we subscribe to, & therefore only making a tiny fraction of its potential value
<li>The reason for this is simple: the Web may have solved the problem of accessing data & information, but it didn't provide any help with processing & aggregating the information & data, or an interface to consume it effectively
<li>The Web Wide Matrix is an abstraction layer over the Web, that tries to solve this problem using:
  <ol>
    <li>A new uniform way to access information & data</a>
    <li>A mechanism for easily processing & aggregating data</a>
    <li>An interface for effectively consuming information & data</a>
  </ol>
</ul>
