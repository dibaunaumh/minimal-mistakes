    excerpt: "If you're like us, you probably feel every day the pain of not coping with the amount of information you receive from your content feeds (email, slack, twitter, blogs &c).
We believe the problem starts with **the interface**, so we're building a different interface powered by a new **consumption layer** over the web.
Here's some slides describing the problem & how we're trying to solve it."
